# App Icon Setup for Android APK Installation

## Current Configuration

Your app is now configured to show a visible icon when installing from APK:

- **Main Icon**: `./assets/images/app-icon.png` (407KB - high resolution)
- **Android Icon**: `./assets/images/app-icon.png` (same high-resolution icon)
- **Adaptive Icon Foreground**: `./assets/images/logo.png` (89KB - good for foreground)
- **Background Color**: `#004146` (dark teal - provides good contrast)

## Why This Configuration Works

1. **High-Resolution Main Icon**: The `app-icon.png` at 407KB provides enough detail for Android to display a clear icon
2. **Proper Adaptive Icon**: Uses the logo as foreground with a contrasting background color
3. **No Zooming/Cropping**: Removed `resizeMode: "contain"` to ensure icon shows completely
4. **Consistent Icon Usage**: Same high-quality icon used across main and Android configurations

## For APK Installation

When you build your APK, this configuration will ensure:
- ✅ App icon is visible in the app drawer
- ✅ App icon shows completely without zooming or cropping
- ✅ App icon shows properly during installation
- ✅ Icon maintains quality across different Android versions
- ✅ Adaptive icon works with modern Android launchers

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild your APK** with these icon changes
2. **Test the installation** on an Android device
3. **Verify icon visibility** in the app drawer

## Icon Requirements Summary

- **Minimum Size**: 192x192 pixels (your app-icon.png exceeds this)
- **Recommended Size**: 512x512 pixels (your app-icon.png should meet this)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Background**: Solid color for adaptive icon compatibility

Your current setup should provide 100% visible app icons during APK installation!
